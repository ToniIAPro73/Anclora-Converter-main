The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of Anclora, a maritime-themed task management application, by cloning features from Empoche. The core objective was to create a modern, interactive task manager with unique Temporal Anchoring, gamification, and a personalized dashboard based on user profiles. The engineer followed a phased approach, starting with the base structure and authentication, then moving to core task management (Anclas) and finally the full dashboard. A significant portion of the initial plan, including the basic structure, profile selection, the Puente de Mando dashboard (with Anclas, Hábitos, Objetivos, Presupuesto, Diario), and complex forms with validations, has been implemented. The backend was thoroughly tested, and the frontend was confirmed to be compiling. The engineer proactively presented the completed features and suggested next steps, awaiting user confirmation to proceed. The main challenge was integrating diverse features and complex validation logic, which the engineer addressed by structuring the development into clear, testable phases.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to develop Anclora, a modern task management application cloning Empoche but adapted with a maritime theme, emphasizing Temporal Anchoring. The app will offer a unique user experience through visual, draggable anchors and automatic task organization. Key features include:
- A personalized dashboard (Puente de Mando) based on 4 user profiles (Content Creators, Freelancers, Students, Professionals with Side Projects).
- The dashboard includes Gestión de Anclas (active, overdue, completed, categorized by Hoy/Mañana/Próximamente), Seguimiento de Hábitos (with visual progress), Objetivos del Mes (with editable subtasks), Presupuesto (income/expense categories), and Diario (free text, mood emojis, timestamp).
- Comprehensive Ancla creation/editing forms with validation for title (with emoji/color pickers), description, type (Tarea/Evento), priority, repetition, schedule (All-day toggle, specific dates/times), and alerts.
- Gamification system: Users progress from Grumete to Capitán based on completed tasks, streaks, and points.
- Interactive Marea de Tiempo timeline with drag-and-drop.
- Web notifications for tasks.
- Supabase for backend, including authentication and data storage with RLS.
- Mobile-optimized, minimalist design with a soft pastel color theme and specific CSS classes for consistency.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS (with PostCSS), CRACO.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (via PyMongo), Supabase (for Auth/DB).
- **Architecture**: Full-stack application with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.
- **Data Management**: MongoDB for data persistence, Supabase for authentication and RLS.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, CSS Custom Properties for maritime theme, Glassmorphism, SVG icons.
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for service management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


- ****: This is the main FastAPI application file. It contains the backend logic, API endpoints (prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress), and potentially database interaction logic (models, CRUD operations). The AI engineer modified this file to establish the backend foundation for user profiles, dashboard features, and task management.
- ****: The main React component, serving as the entry point for the frontend application. It likely handles routing, overall layout, and integrating different sections/components of the application. The AI engineer modified this file to integrate the initial dashboard structure and profile selection.
- ****: Contains global and utility CSS styles for the React application, likely setting up the base theme, fonts, and general layout. The AI engineer modified this to apply the specified soft pastel, maritime theme and design principles.
- ****: A newly created file intended to house reusable React components for the dashboard functionalities and forms. This file is crucial for organizing the UI logic for Gestión de Anclas, Seguimiento de Hábitos, Objetivos del Mes, Presupuesto, and Diario components, as well as the complex Ancla creation/editing forms with their validations.
- ** and **: These files store environment variables such as  for the backend and  for the frontend, ensuring no hardcoding of URLs or sensitive information.
- ** and **: Define Python and Node.js dependencies, respectively. The AI engineer ensured all necessary libraries were added to these files during installation.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Timeline interactivo (Marea de tiempo)**: Implement drag & drop functionality for tasks on a timeline.
- **Notificaciones web**: Set up service workers for timely task reminders with quick actions.
- **Analítica visual y flujos de tareas automatizados**: Future functionalities mentioned in the product description.
- **Integraciones adicionales**: Slack and Stripe (as optional features if requested by user).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed the initial implementation of the Anclora application, focusing on establishing the core structure and key dashboard functionalities.
The current product state includes:
1.  **Base Structure**: Functional selection of 4 distinct user profiles (Content Creators, Freelancers, Students, Professionals with Side Projects), each designed to have customizable pre-defined content.
2.  **Dashboard (Puente de Mando)**: The main dashboard is built out, incorporating four primary components:
    *   **Gestión de Anclas**: Displays tasks (anchors) categorized into Activos (Hoy, Mañana, Próximamente), Vencidos, and Completados.
    *   **Seguimiento de Hábitos**: Features visual progress bars and percentages for tracking habits.
    *   **Objetivos del Mes**: Shows monthly goals with editable subtasks.
    *   **Presupuesto**: Includes specific income/expense categories per user profile.
    *   **Diario**: Provides a free-text area with an emoji-based mood selector and automatic timestamps.
3.  **Forms and Validations**:
    *   A comprehensive Formulario de Anclas is implemented, supporting title (with emoji/color pickers), description, type (Tarea/Evento), priority, repetition, flexible scheduling (all-day toggle, specific dates/times), and alerts. All specified validation rules (e.g., character limits, date consistency) are integrated.
4.  **Gamification**: The initial framework for the maritime-themed gamification system is in place, including user ranks from Grumete to Capitán based on task completion.
5.  **Design**: The application adheres to the maritime theme with a soft pastel color palette, a responsive and modern interface, and visual effects like glassmorphism and animations.
The backend has been fully tested, and all APIs are reported as functioning correctly. Frontend compilation is successful, indicating a runnable application. The application is hosted and accessible via a preview URL. The AI engineer is awaiting user feedback on testing the frontend or proceeding with advanced features.
